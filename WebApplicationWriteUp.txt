	If I were building this command line program as a full-scale web application, I would do several things differently. First, I would pull the paging functionality out into a separate controller to improve the reusability of the code and to make future modifications of the code simpler. I would consider writing the application in a different language, such as AngularJS, that had data binding and dependency injection in order to make displaying my data easier. Since the information we are requesting is public rather than confidential, and the food trucks list is only updated periodically, not constantly, I would investigate the possible benefits of caching some of the data. Finally, I would sign up for and include an app token in my requests to avoid throttling.
